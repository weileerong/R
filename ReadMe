I created this project when I have studied statistics and R for a year. 
Those are files I created when I practice along with books or my classes.
It Includes what I have learned at my pitt classes: statistical learning and data science, multivariate analysis, time series analysis and data mining.

I saved my practice files and project files here, just make them to be well orgainzed. 
I also intend to build them day by day as a personal code shelf.

Some of the materials I learned along with are refered at the beginning of the files.  But, some are not, please forgive me then.
