I created this project when I have studied statistics and R for a year. 
Those files include my project code and practice code.
It Includes what I have learned: statistical learning and data science, multivariate analysis, time series analysis and data mining.
I learned these from books, udemy, my courses, Linda, coursera and online communities. 

I intend to build them day by day as a personal code shelf.
